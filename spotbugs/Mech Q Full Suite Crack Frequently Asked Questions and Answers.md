- **Mechanical:** This module includes tools for creating gears, springs, fasteners, conveyors and other mechanical components. You can also use it to generate mechanical symbols, housings and bearings.
- **Piping:** This module includes tools for creating 2D and 3D piping systems, including fittings, valves, flanges and supports. You can also use it to generate isometrics and P&ID diagrams.
- **Ducting:** This module includes tools for creating 2D and 3D ducting systems, including rectangular, round and flat oval shapes. You can also use it to generate ducting symbols and labels.
- **Structural:** This module includes tools for creating 2D and 3D structural elements, such as beams, columns, stairs, ladders and trusses. You can also use it to generate steel details, shapes and connections.

Mech-Q Full Suite is used by more than 25,000 engineering and drafting professionals worldwide[^1^]. It is compatible with all versions of AutoCAD and other IntelliCAD products[^2^]. It also supports DWG files, which means you can share and use your files with AutoCAD without any conversion required[^2^].
 
If you want to try Mech-Q Full Suite for yourself, you can download a free trial from the ASVIC website[^1^]. You can also purchase a monthly, yearly or perpetual license depending on your needs[^3^]. Mech-Q Full Suite comes with 12 months of free updates and extended update plans are available[^3^].
 
Mech-Q Full Suite is a great choice for engineers who want to boost their productivity and efficiency. It offers a comprehensive solution for all your engineering design needs. Whether you are working on mechanical, piping, ducting or structural projects, Mech-Q Full Suite can help you create high-quality parts and drawings in less time and with less hassle.
  
## How to Use Mech-Q Full Suite for Your Engineering Projects
 
Using Mech-Q Full Suite is easy and intuitive. You can access the modules from the Mech-Q menu or toolbar in your CAD software. You can also use the Mech-Q command line to enter commands and options. Each module has its own dialog box where you can select the part or drawing you want to create or modify. You can also adjust the parameters, such as size, shape, orientation, color and layer.
 
For example, if you want to create a 3D pipe system, you can use the Piping module and select the Pipe option. You can then choose the pipe type, size, schedule and material. You can also specify the start and end points of the pipe and the bend radius. You can then add fittings, valves and supports from the dialog box or by using the right-click menu. You can also use the Auto-BOM option to generate a bill of materials for your pipe system.
