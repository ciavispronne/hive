# How to Play Wartune on a Private Server
 
Wartune is a free-to-play strategy MMORPG that combines turn-based combat, city-building, and role-playing elements. You can create your own hero, customize your skills and equipment, and join forces with other players to fight against enemies and bosses in various dungeons and battlegrounds.
 
However, if you want to enjoy Wartune without the limitations of the official servers, such as VIP levels, recharge costs, and server lag, you might want to try playing on a private server. A private server is a fan-made version of the game that runs on a separate server and has different features and settings than the official one. Some private servers may offer higher rates of experience, gold, and items, as well as more content and events.
